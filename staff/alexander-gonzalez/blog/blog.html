  <p>Cats may not really have nine lives, but factors such as diet, healthcare and environment can have an impact on how long a cat can live.
  Neutered cats tend to live longer because neutering prevents reproductive diseases and neutered cats are less likely to roam.

    While dependent on many things, including luck, some domestic cats can live to up to 20 years old. 
    During their life they will go through six key life stages which may help owners understand certain health/behavioural problems that could arise and things to keep an eye on.</p>
