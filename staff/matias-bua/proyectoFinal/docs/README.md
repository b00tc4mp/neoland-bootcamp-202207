# Description

This auction application is designed for those little artists who want to start their business, giving you the possibility to publish your creations where they can be made known!
Its mobile design allows you to follow your favorite auctions and be able to bid on them without having to be on a computer, giving you the possibility of following them remotely!

## Funcional Description

In this application will allow you to connect from anywhere and access the possibilities of creating a generic user for everyone, with which everyone can create publications that are auctions, you can also make them on categories, and bid on those that have generated the interest of users, being able to bid on the product.
our system is adapted to all audiences, but we will have the restriction of a minimum of 18 years to be able to freely have the necessary bank details in their auctions or sales, we also have a profile section that will also have the possibility to notify their interest in some type of article by publishing an offer of interest so that any user can contact its creator.
